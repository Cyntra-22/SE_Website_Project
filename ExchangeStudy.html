        Additionally, in each year, there are 1 - 3 courses in the M.Sc. in High
        Integrity Systems program at FRA-UAS with transferable credits which you
        may take. The list of the courses is to be announced a few months before
        the exchange begins.<br />
        The following courses are the courses in the SE program in Year 3
        Semester 2 which have no equivalent counterpart at FRA-UAS. You are to
        take these courses in Year 4 Semester 2 instead:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Science & Technology for the Modern World</li>
        <li>
          Software Verification and Validation (unless the M.Sc. course
          "Advanced Testing Techniques" is taken at FRA-UAS)
        </li>
        <li>Software Development Process</li>

    <!--Assessment-->
    <div style="height: 100%; background-color: white" class="requirement">
      <h3>2. Assessment</h3>
      <p>
        The internship is an assessed component of your study. During the
        internship, the company will monitor your performance and then submit
        their assessment to the International College. The company's assessment
        will cover various aspects of your internship, including:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>the quality and quantity of your work</li>
        <li>your attendance record</li>
        <li>
          other attributes a good software engineer should possess, such as
          punctuality, responsibility, human relations, creativity, etc.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        After your internship, you are required to submit an internship report
        and give a presentation of your work and your internship experience to
        the internship assessment committee. The committee will then evaluate
        your internship and give you either grade S (Satisfactory) or U
        (Unsatisfactory).
      </p>

      <h3>2.1 Internship report</h3>
      <p>
        An internship report is a short report (1,500 words or more) detailing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a brief outline of the company (its size, its main activities, the
          division or project in which you were employed, etc.);
        </li>
        <li>
          the original placement description and objectives (and any later
          changes to these);
        </li>
        <li>what you actually did;</li>
        <li>
          an honest evaluation of how successfully you achieved your objectives;
        </li>
        <li>
          a summary of what you learned from working in an industrial
          environment (for example, tools, techniques, processes, group working,
          deadlines);
        </li>
        <li>
          a reflection on the value of the placement, and how it could have been
          better.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <i
        >The report should not just be a detailed technical description of what
        you did. The assessment committee is looking for a coherent, literate
        report in order to understand how your project fitted into the company
        you were working for, what you achieved, and your reflections on how the
        internship fitted into your educational experience.</i
      >
      <p>
        Here are some hints on preparing a good report. Make sure that your
        report has a clear logical structure – it should not be just an
        unstructured flow of words telling a story. Avoid simply quoting PR
        material about the organisation you worked for – think about what the
        reader needs to know about the organisation in order to understand the
        context of your work. Do not focus on minute technical detail describing
        intricate pieces of code that you wrote.<br />
        The biggest problem for most students seems to be reflecting on the
        internship experience.<br />
        Here are some questions you might like to think about in developing this
        part of the report:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What new skills did you learn?</li>
        <li>
          What existing skills did you exercise or improve during the
          internship?
        </li>
        <li>
          Did your internship experience reinforce your existing knowledge? (Did
          you observe techniques taught at the International College actually
          used in practice?)
        </li>
        <li>
          Were there any techniques that you would like to have known before
          undertaking the internship?
        </li>
        <li>How could the internship experience have been improved?</li>
        <li>
          What knowledge and experience will you take forward as the most
          important lessons from your internship?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <i
        >Both the content of the report and the quality of writing will be taken
        into account.</i
      >

      <h3>2.2 Presentation</h3>
      <p>
        After your internship, you are required to present your work and your
        experience during the internship to the assessment committee and your
        colleagues. You should plan for a 20-minute presentation, which will be
        followed by a 10-minute QA session.
      </p>
      <h3>2.3 Absence during internship</h3>
      <p>
        If, for any reason, you need to take a leave during the internship, you
        must ask for permission from the company. You must also submit a
        document supporting the request for your leave to your supervisor in the
        company (or a person who makes a record of your attendance). Absence
        without notice will result in failing the internship.
